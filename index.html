        <h1>About the course</h1>
        <p>Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. But you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch movies. 
            And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy watching a movie.</p>
        <p>In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers. 
            We will get acquainted with the stages of film production and learn how to watch a movie through the eyes of a screenwriter, director and editor.
            We will understand genres and look at the most important films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.</p>
